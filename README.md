## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of aircraft engines is crucial for **predictive maintenance** in aviation. This project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to analyze time-series sensor data from the **C-MAPSS dataset** and estimate the number of operational cycles before an engine fails.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset: C-MAPSS
The **C-MAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset** is widely used for **prognostics and health management (PHM)** tasks. It contains multivariate sensor readings from multiple engines operating under different conditions.

### ðŸ“Š Features:
- **21 Engine Sensors** (Temperature, Pressure, Fan Speed, etc.)
- **Operating Conditions** (Altitude, Mach Number, etc.)
- **Engine Cycles** (Time-series degradation patterns)
- **RUL Labels** (Ground truth for training and evaluation)

## ðŸš€ Model: LSTM-based Time Series Prediction
LSTM networks are chosen due to their ability to capture **long-term dependencies** in sequential data. The model takes historical sensor readings and predicts the **RUL** at each time step.

### **Architecture:**
âœ” **LSTM Layers** for sequence learning  
âœ” **Dropout Layers** for regularization  
âœ” **Dense Layers** for RUL regression  
âœ” **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function
